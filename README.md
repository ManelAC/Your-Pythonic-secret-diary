## How to use
The first thing you will need to use this program is a copy of the files in the `src` and the `assets` folders.

Once you have them, you will need to execute them in your favourite Python environment. Since this program was developed in a Python 3.9 version, I recommend you to use at least that version too, although you can test your luck in other versions if you want to.

The last thing you will need to use this is the library `bcrypt`. In this case we used the 3.2.2 version of it, but you may have luck using different versions.

In case you don't have this library you can install easily using `pip`. You just need to run the following command:
```bash
pip install foobar
```

Once you are done with all these steps, you just need to execute the `main.py` file, go to the Diaries menu, create your first diary and open it. After that everything should be quite self-explanatory.
